# NeighborhoodMap
===============================

# Install
- This game is installed by copying all the files to a directory.
- Launch the index.html found in the base directory in your favorite browser.

# Features of the Map
- The _map_ will load with all markers displayed.
- There is a _fitler menu_ in the upper left.
- You can use the drop down to filter the markers displayed.
- When you click on a marker or its name in the filter menu, it displays information about that marker.
- I left the two golf courses in the list to show what happens when a wikipedia search returns nothing.
